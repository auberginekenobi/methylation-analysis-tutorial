## Lab notebook

Things I have learned so far:
 - Lots of bioconda packages will will only build on intel cpus. If you are using conda and 
apple silicon, see 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71515117/how-to-set-up-a-conda-osx-64-environment-on-arm-mac
- Using conda to install R packages (minfi and conumee + dependencies) seems to exceed the 
RAM limit for [mybinder.org](mybinder.org). See
